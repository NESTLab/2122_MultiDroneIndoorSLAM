# Coms üì°
Distributed Communication Protocol for Robots running [ROS1](https://www.ros.org).

## Overview üîç
Coms acts as a middleman between all network traffic, regardless of the deployment environment. It takes care of all robot-to-robot communications, whether they are deployed on raspberry pis, or run within a simulation environment such as Gazebo. This package enables your ROS nodes to rely on a standard communication protocol for external message passing. In essence, Coms works as a ROS1 implementation of a multi-master approach for orchestrating distributed ad-hoc networks.

## ROS Topics üí¨
For simulations, the Sim._broadcaster sends a `nearby.msg` to the `/nearby_robots` topic whenever it sees another robot in line of site. Different physics simulations, such as ARGos and Gazebo, have their own way of determining line-of-site. Based on the configuration run by
the `ros-net-sim` package, a given physics_sim may be invoked to match the robot's environment.

ARGos3 - Line-of-site topics are generated for each robot run within its physics engine.
The broadcaster subscribes to a given `/robot<num>/line-of-site` topic and re-broadcasts them on a regular interval to the `/nearby_robots` topic for other ROS nodes.

## Debugging üîß
We expose the topic: `/tb3_0/coms_debug` to see what's going on in the coms node. You can see sync and ping requests from neighbors and watch connections open & close. If you send a trigger to the topic: `/tb3_0/coms_listening`, you can see that too!

### Try it out

```zsh
# Start the simulation
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo multi_turtlebot3_all.launch
```

```zsh
# Listen to the coms debugging channel 
$ rostopic echo /tb3_0/coms_debug
```

```zsh
# Ask coms to invoke a sync
# NOTE: tb3_0 is bound to 192.168.0.1
#       tb3_1 is bound to 192.168.0.2
$ rostopic pub /tb3_0/coms_listening std_msgs/String "sync|192.168.0.2|"
```

The result:
```log

```

## Ready
A ROS service is available at `/tb3_X/ready_to_meet`, defined within `coms/coms/srv/ReadyToMeet.srv`:
```
# ReadyToMeet.srv
string robot_ip
bool status
---
bool is_ready
```

This service asks the robot_ip if it's ready for a meeting, returning `bool is_ready`. If the robot is unreachable, an error will be logged in `/tb3_X/coms_debug` while returning `False`.

You can also test this by running:
```zsh
$ rostopic pub /tb3_0/coms_listening std_msgs/String "ready|192.168.0.2|true"
```
> NOTE: This will not change any state, but only probe the other robot in the the logs.
